# ModerationTools

A moderation plugin for TABG-DS. Requires my other plugin, [Citruslib](https://github.com/CyrusTheLesser/Citruslib)

<h1>How to use</h1>

Install the mod and launch the server once to get the extra settings in the ExtraSettings.json file. The settings should be... self explanatory.

To collect Epic IDs for use in the BanList, you can find them in the Guestbook folder, which keeps track of every plaer who has joined your server.

The mod also adds some functions for kicking and bannning players in-game. their functionality should get added to the command list when the server launches.
